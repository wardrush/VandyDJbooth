Images for breadboard schematic are in this repos. The numerical values for capacitance and resistance
are not necessarily accurate. The resistance and capacitance should be related according to the formula

cutoff point = 1/(2*pi*R*C) 

where R and C are in Ohms and Farads respectively and the cutoff point in Hz.
